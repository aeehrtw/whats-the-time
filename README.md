What's the time project

# How to run

1. Download the source code
2. Execute the spring boot application 
   - (I used my IntelliJ IDE.)
   - You can use `.\mvnw spring-boot:run` to execute
   - Change the `timeString` to test it out
3. Alternatively check the WhatsthetimeApplication.java, uncomment the lines as mentioned in the comment. Execute to get a commandline util which takes inputs in a loop.
